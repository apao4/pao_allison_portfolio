                            <p> Every 10 minutes, another patient is added to the waitlist for an organ transplant.
                                With that being said there is a huge discrepancy between the demand and the availability 
                                of organs.  My team and I created an entire marketing campaign in hopes of bringing awareness
                                to the pressing need through research, various marketing deliverables as well as merchandise.   </p>

                                <h3>Infuser Bottle Design</h3>
                                <p> It is suggested that each day, a minimum of 8 glasses of water are consumed.  However, through a survey
                                    conducted for this assignment, it was discovered that only 35% of young adults between the ages of 18-24 
                                    are achieving this important goal.  My partner and I designed a water bottle to promote the habit of 
                                    drinking water with the implementation of a fruit infuser.  
                                </p>
                                <h4>Process</h4>
                                <h6>1. Research</h6>
                                <p> Research was gathered in regards to water drinking habits of young adults as well as the various features that were
                                    preferred by our targetted demographic.  A lot of research was also found in relation to other brands out there 
                                    currently.  This helped to give us an idea of positioning amongst other competitors.  Following the general research 
                                    that was found, we created a survey that would be distributed to students within the targetted demographic to get a personal
                                    insight on the trends and habits.  
                                </p>
                                <h6>2. Analysis</h6>
                                <p> Research is useless if it is not analyzed properly.  After all research was collected and surveys were filled, we began breaking
                                    the information and data down to filter what was important to my project and what was not.  This is when we began compiling the case 
                                    study.  
                                </p>
                                <h6>3. Brainstorm</h6>
                                <p> Once the research and surveys were thoroughly analyzed, we began brainstorming ideas including sketches and a concept map. 
                                    This helped to finalize an idea and narrow in on what key features we wanted to include were.  
                                </p>
                                <h6>4. Finalize Ideas</h6>
                                <p> After brainstorming, we finalized all of our ideas and began making final design drafts. 
                                </p>
                                <h6>5. Case Study & Style Guide</h6>
                                <p> In our case study, we included our research and survey findings as well as described what we were trying to achieve with our design and branding.
                                    In the style guide, specific design features were explained such as logo, typography, positioning, etc.  
                                </p>
                                <h6>6. Marketing</h6>
                                <p> As a last step to this project, we took the bottle to the real world with marketing ideas.  Through further research as well as 
                                    previous experience, we established the best marketing techniques that would benefit our company such as billboards and posters in popular transportation
                                    hubs as we designed our bottle for those who are constantly on-the-go.
