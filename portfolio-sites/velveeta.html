                    <p> Stay golden with liquid gold!

                    <h4>Process</h4>
                    <h6>1. Research</h6>
                    <p> Prior to this assignment, I was completely unaware of what Velveeta was.  With extensive research, I was able to get
                        a better grasp at the branding of the product line.  Once this research was done, I began to brainstorm.  
                    </p>
                    <h6>2. Brainstorm</h6>
                    <p> I wanted to take the childhood favourite product and make a brand new modern design out of it.  This was challenging at first as product
                        already had such an established branding style with its bold primary colours and child-like patterns.  The existing branding did not suit the 
                        modern aesthetic that I wanted to accomplish. It took hours and many disposable ideas for me to finally hit my eureka moment.
                    </p>
                    <h6>3. Design</h6>
                    <p> It finally dawned on me how I would achieve my modern branding of the cheese line.  I took the underline of the logo and transformed that into a full
                        mosaic that would make the base of my label. I then took the V from the logo and used that as the focus of my logo.  After sketching and brainstorming,
                        I decided to make the "V" itself a lighthouse style window in the label so that the wine would show through it.  I thought this would make the label 
                        more interesting and eye-catching as that is not a commonly used design.
                    </p>
                    <h6>4. Style Guide</h6>
                    <p> With so much work done in regards to the branding ideas of my product, I wanted to display them using a style guide.  In my style guide, I included information
                        on my style ideaas as well as advertisements that I had made also in the style of Velveeta.
