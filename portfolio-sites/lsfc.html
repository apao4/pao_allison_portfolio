                    <h3>London Squash and Fitness Club Redesign</h3>
                    <p> The London Squash and Fitness Club located in London, Ontario, reached out looking for a revamping of their site.  
                        Through the redesign, the owners of the club were looking to achieve a modern feel to their brand as well as expanding
                        their current demographic to a younger one by including more students.  My partner and I redesigned the site and social 
                        media plans completely in hopes of benefiting the clients.  
                    </p>
                    <h6>Research</h6>
                    <p> Many visits were made the to location itself to completely understand the values and current feel of the club.
                        My partner and I also gathered our own images during these tours as their previous photos on their website were not
                        high quality and did not suit our redesign.  These visits also allowed us to speak with the owners and comprehend to 
                        our fully abilities what their specific goals and values were.  
                    </p>
                    <h6>Social Media</h6>
                    <p> With the intentions of expanding to younger audiences, my partner and I found it beneficial to utilize social media 
                        to their advantage.  We created mockups of Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter posts that would engage younger users and potential
                        club members as well as mockup schedules and posts.   
                    </p>
                    <h6>Web Design</h6>
                    <p> My partner and I wanted to keep the branding the same in regards to colour schemes while completely updating the site.  
                        We focused on large and bold graphics that would draw lots of attention to the site.  We feature a couple of photo galleries
                        to further emphasize the visual aspect of the design.  
                    </p>
