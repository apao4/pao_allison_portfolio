                    <h3>The Plastic Ocean</h3>
                    <p> You may think Texas is large, but did you know there are two patches of garbage spinning in the ocean that equate to more than 2 times the size of 
                        Texas.  With that being said, I am very passionate about recycling and waste reduction, therefore, I designed and developed an infographic that makes
                        the mass issue easier to digest.  Featuring bright colours and simple icons, this infographic works to spread awareness on the issue at hand in a simple 
                        and enjoyable way.  
                    </p>
                    <p> With great passion, I put a lot of research into this infographic.  Once I found a ton of statistics and interesting information that I believed would support 
                        my graphics, I began sketching out several ideas.  From this point, I began illustrating various elements on Adobe Illustrator and then was completely 
                        absorbed by my work and completed it.
